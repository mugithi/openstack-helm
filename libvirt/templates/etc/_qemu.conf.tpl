# The backend to use for handling stdout/stderr output from
# QEMU processes.
#
#  'file': QEMU writes directly to a plain file. This is the
#          historical default, but allows QEMU to inflict a
#          denial of service attack on the host by exhausting
#          filesystem space
#
#  'logd': QEMU writes to a pipe provided by virtlogd daemon.
#          This is the current default, providing protection
#          against denial of service by performing log file
#          rollover when a size limit is hit.
